        <p>Crocheting is a craft that is done with yarn and a tool called a hook. A crochet project can be done mindlessly (great for relaxing or bingeing a show), or with focus for more intricate designs. It’s a versatile hobby used to create everythings, from clothes to blankets to stuffies to decor.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Yarn_Weights">
        <header class="main-headers">Yarn Weights</header>
        <p>The yarn used for crocheting comes in a variety of sizes. Yarn is categorized by its thickness, known as the yarn’s weight. Each weight has a corresponding number and name.</p> 
        <p>Yarn weights are listed below (from thinnest to thickest):
</p>
        <div class="list-wrap1">
        <ul class="weights">
          <li>0 - lace</li>
          <li>1 - fingering</li>
          <li>2 - sport</li>
          <li>3 - dk (double knitting)</li>
          <li>4 - worsted</li>
          <li>5 - bulky</li>
          <li>6 - super bulky</li>
          <li>7 - jumbo</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Yarn_Fibres">
        <header class="main-headers">Yarn Fibres</header>
        <p>Yarn can be made with a variety of fibres, including cotton, acrylic, wools or blends. Here is some examples of some yarn materials and what fibre they are made of: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Cotton</em>: made from plant fibres</li>
          <li><em>Acrylic</em>: made from plastic</li>
          <li><em>Wool</em>: made from animal fibres</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The fibre should be chosen according to what kind of project is being made. For dishclothes (or anything that requires absorbing water), cotton yarn is a good choice. To make decor tapestries, many colors are often needed. Acrylic yarn is a good choice for this, as it is relatively cheaper and easier to find. For winter wearables, like hats or sweaters, wool is a good choice as it produces a breathable fabric in the finished piece. Acrylic yarn could be used for wearables, but it produces a heavier,  non-breathable fabric. Some individuals might find this uncomfortable to wear as a sweater, but might like it as a scarf. Others might not like wool for sweaters because they find it itchy. The bottom line is to choose what works for you, personally.</p>

        <header class="main-headers">Hooks</header>
        <p>Like yarn, crochet hooks can also come in a variety of materials. Common materials include aluminum, plastic and bamboo. A hook can also come with an ergonomic handle or without.</p>
        <p>A hook’s size is based on the diameter of its shaft (thickest part of the hook) and is denoted in millimetres (mm). Smaller hooks are usually used with thinner yarn. This can change, however, depending on the type of fabric you want to produce.</p>

        <header class="main-headers">Basic Stitches and Terms</header>
        <p>Crochet terminology is in US terms or UK terms. Some basic stitches and their abbreviations are given below.</p>

        <table class="terms-chart">
          <thead>
            <tr>

              <th scope="col">UK term</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>single crochet (sc)</td>
              <td>double crochet (dc)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>half-double crochet (hdc)</td>

            <tr>
              <td>triple crochet (tr)</td>
              <td>double-treble crochet (dtr)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        </div>

        <p>Here are instructions on how to perform some of the basic stitches: </p>

        <code><em>**[US stitch term] (abbreviation)**: [how to]</em></code>
        <code>**slip stitch (sl st)** insert hook into stitch, yarn over, pull through everything on hook </code>
        <code>**single crochet (sc)** insert hook into stitch, yarn over and pull through stitch, yarn over and pull through the 2 loops on hook </code>
        <code>**half-double crochet (hdc)** yarn over, insert hook into stitch, yarn over and pull through stitch, yarn over and pull through all 3 loops on hook</code>
        <code>**double crochet (dc)** yarn over, insert hook into stitch, yarn over and pull through stitch, yarn over and pull through 2 of the loops on the hook, yarn over again and pull through the 2 loops on the hook </code>
        <code>**triple crochet (tr)** yarn over, insert hook into stitch, yarn over and pull through stitch, yarn over and pull through 2 of the loops on the hook, yarn over again and pull through the 2 loops on the hook </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Choosing_the_Right_Hook_Size">
        <header class="main-headers">Choosing the Right Hook Size</header>
        <p>The first step is to check the yarn label for a recommended hook size. Then, depending on what you want to make, choose the hook size you will work with. Generally speaking, use smaller hook sizes for projects needing more structure and bigger hook sizes for projects that need more drape. For example, to make amigurumi (aka a stuffie), the resulting fabric needs to be tight so that stuffing does not escape between stitches. So, use a hook that is 1-2 mm smaller than the recommended hook size on the label. To make a blanket that is loose and drapey, use a hook size that is larger than what is recommended.</p>
        <p>The best practice is to make a swatch with your chosen yarn and hook to see if you like the resulting fabric. To make a swatch, crochet in the stitch of your project to make a small square of fabric. You can also use this to measure your gauge. Gauge is how many stitches and rows fit in an inch of fabric. Use a gauge swatch to accurately plan how big the finished project will be.</p>
